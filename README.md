# 2-player-guess-the-number
So this is a 2 player game made entirely made from python. The code took me 2 days to complete and i hope you play it.
# How to play
player 1 picks a number and they can troll, but can't show player 2 what the number is.Player 2 will pick a number between 1 and 100. i use replit if you use replit and and copy the code from the code file you will have made my game.
